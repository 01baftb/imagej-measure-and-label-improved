# Measure and Label Improved for ImageJ

This JS script for ImageJ will measure the current line selection and label it with its length. The line/label will be saved non-destructively to overlay or ROI manager. Users will also be given a dialog box to update the properties of the line/label such as color and size. 

This script is an improvement of existing [Measure and Label macro](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/plugins/measure-label.html), which creates a label, but that label is a measurement number or a manually set label and does NOT include the actual length of the line selection. This script will actually measure the line selection and create a label with it's length.
